# Build Instructions (EN)

This is a detailed guide with images. tl;dr -> [Assembly List](/documentation/Assembly%20List.md)

## General Info
- If you don't know how to solder, look at [How to solder](/documentation/How%20to%20Solder.md)
- All components are placed on the side of the board, where their marking is. Soldering is done on the opposite side.
- Some components are directional -> Orientation matters. This is denoted with a "Caution" tag, cause it's important. Double-check orientation **before** soldering.
- If you are not sure about something: Ask before soldering üòâ
- Have fun. üë©‚Äçüè≠üë®‚Äçüè≠

### First Component - Diode: D9
- <span style="color:green">Image: Diode detail image</span>
- Bend the legs of the Diode (U-shape)
- Place it on the board at position D9.
> [!Caution]
> For this part the orientation is important! Silver ring to the right.

**Congratulations, you're done with soldering. Only a few steps are left.**

### Place Jumpers
- Place the Jumper connectors as shown in the image
  - JP1, JP2, JP3 on the top position
  - OFF/ON: on the left position (OFF)
- <span style="color:green">Image: Jumper connectors placed</span>

### Attach and connect battery
- wrap the battery in tape (for insulation)
- use the rubber band to attach the battery to the back of the board (see image)
- connect the battery to the battery connector
- <span style="color:green">Image: battery attached and connected</span>

### Attach string (optional)
- <span style="color:green">Image: string connected</span>

### You're done! Plug the Jumper "OFF/ON" to the right position and enjoy. ‚ú®
Turn the two potentiometers to adjust the blinking pattern and speed.
